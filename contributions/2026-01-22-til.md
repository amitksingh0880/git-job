# TIL: CSS Flexbox Alignment

**Date:** January 22, 2026

## What I Learned

Discovered that `justify-content` controls alignment on the main axis, while `align-items` controls alignment on the cross axis. `align-self` can override `align-items` for individual items.

## Why It Matters

This knowledge helps write more efficient and maintainable code. Understanding these concepts is crucial for professional development.
