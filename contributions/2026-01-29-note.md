# Technical Note: Microservices Architecture Patterns

**Date:** January 29, 2026

## Key Patterns

### 1. API Gateway
- Single entry point for all clients
- Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting
- Reduces client complexity

### 2. Service Discovery
- Dynamic service registration
- Load balancing
- Health checks

### 3. Circuit Breaker
- Prevents cascading failures
- Fast failure detection
- Automatic recovery

## Benefits
- Scalability
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity

## Challenges
- Distributed system complexity
- Data consistency
- Network latency

## References
- Industry best practices
- Official documentation
- Real-world implementations
