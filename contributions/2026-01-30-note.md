### Indexing Strategy
- Create indexes on frequently queried columns
- Avoid over-indexing (slows writes)
- Use composite indexes for multi-column queries

### Query Performance

- Avoid SELECT * in production
- Limit result sets with pagination

### Connection Pooling
- Reuse database connections
- Configure pool size based on load
- Monitor connection usage

## Monitoring
- Track slow queries
- Monitor index usage
- Analyze query patterns

## References
- Industry best practices
- Official documentation
- Real-world implementations
